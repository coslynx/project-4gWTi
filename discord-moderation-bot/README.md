# Discord Moderation Bot

## Project Overview:
Develop a discord moderation bot to help manage and maintain discord servers efficiently.

## Features:
- Kick and Ban:
  - Allow moderators to kick or ban users from the server.
- Mute and Unmute:
  - Enable muting and unmuting of users to control chat disruptions.
- Warn and Strike System:
  - Implement a warning system to track user behavior and issue strikes for rule violations.
- Auto-Moderation:
  - Configure automated moderation features to filter out spam, links, and inappropriate content.
- Custom Commands:
  - Set up custom commands for quick access to frequently used moderation actions.
- Logging:
  - Keep detailed logs of moderation actions for transparency and record-keeping purposes.
- Role Management:
  - Assign and remove roles based on user behavior or server rules.
- Slow Mode:
  - Enable slow mode to limit the frequency of messages in channels.
- Welcome and Goodbye Messages:
  - Create customizable messages to greet new users and bid farewell to departing members.

## Enhancements:
- User Reputation System:
  - Introduce a reputation system to reward positive user interactions and deter negative behavior.
- Scheduled Messages:
  - Implement scheduled messages for announcements, reminders, or server events.
- Vote Kick:
  - Allow members to initiate a vote kick process for problematic users.
- Anti-Spam Measures:
  - Enhance spam detection algorithms to minimize spamming in the server.
- User Activity Monitoring:
  - Track user activity to identify potential issues or inactive members.
- Integration with Modmail:
  - Integrate with a modmail system for efficient communication between moderators and users.

## Programming Languages:
- Python will be used as the primary programming language due to its simplicity and extensive libraries for Discord bot development.

## APIs:
- Discord API: To interact with the Discord platform, manage servers, channels, and users.
- Google's Perspective API: To analyze messages and detect inappropriate content for auto-moderation.
- Discord Webhooks API: To send notifications and logs to specified channels for monitoring.

## Packages and Libraries:
- discord.py (Latest Version): A Python wrapper for the Discord API, providing easy integration and event handling.
- requests (Latest Version): To make HTTP requests to external APIs like Google's Perspective API for content analysis.
- datetime (Built-in): For managing timestamps and scheduling messages.
- asyncio (Built-in): To handle asynchronous tasks efficiently for bot operations.

## Rationale:
- Python is widely used for Discord bot development, offering simplicity and readability for easier maintenance.
- discord.py is a popular library with extensive documentation and community support, making it ideal for building a robust bot.
- Using Google's Perspective API enhances the bot's auto-moderation capabilities by detecting inappropriate content effectively.
- Discord Webhooks API enables seamless communication of logs and notifications for better transparency in moderation actions.

By leveraging these programming languages, APIs, packages, and libraries, the discord moderation bot will be equipped with the necessary tools to effectively manage and maintain discord servers while ensuring a positive and organized community environment.
